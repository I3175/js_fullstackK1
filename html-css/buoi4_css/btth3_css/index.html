                    <b>Tip: </b> The word <b>cascading </b> means that a style applied to a parent elements
                    will also apply to all children elements within the parent. So, if you set the color of
                    the body text to "blue", all headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the 
                    body will also get the same color (unless you specify something else)!
